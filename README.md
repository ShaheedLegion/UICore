# UICore
UICore is a C++ toolkit library focusing on user interfaces and graphics:
* Features a Model/View/Controller (MVC) design for building cross platform UI applications
* Uses modern HTML/CSS principles for layout such as flex-box and CSS properties for styling
* Is not based on a HTML layout engine (such as WebKit or Chromium) and therefore does not require code written in JavaScript
* Hi-DPI support built-in. Rendering and layout are done using device independent pixels
* No binding code required to connect the C++ model with a Javascript DOM frontend
* Fast hardware accelerated 2D canvas
* Low-level cross platform OpenGL/Direct3D abstraction for custom 3D or specialized 2D operations
* Direct3D 11 and OpenGL 4 support
* Designed for modern C++ (C++11, C++14)
* Many useful matrix, vector and other graphics related math classes
* Various commonly useful utility classes such as network, XML, JSON, file and zip (deflate) classes
* Supports Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X
